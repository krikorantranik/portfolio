Accomplished professional with a Masterâ€™s in Data Analytics and 8+ years of Analytics, Engineering and Data Science. Passionate about telling stories with data
A small sample of pieces of code based on real projects I conducted in my past experiences, adapted to datasets available in open sources.

 
NLP, NN, Time series: Is it possible to predict oil prices using data from Google Trends?
Using first Word2Vec, then scrap from Google Trends for frequency of Google searches, followed by time series (via a Fourier decomposition) and neural networks with Keras, I attempt to predict future oil prices.

 
CV2: Finding patterns on images
I used computer vision and neural networks to find a word in a text written in cursive more than a hundred years ago.

 
Data Lakehouses: Databricks and Synapse Analytics
A quick comparison between these two solutions, Databricks and Synapse Analytics, exploring as well the hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) option, which allows direct and efficient connection to OLTP data in Cosmos.

 
NLP/Doc2Vec: Removing hate speech and offensive tweets
Finding offensive or hate speech tweets, using Doc2Vec and Neural Networks (Keras) for classification.

 
Supervised Classification: Quick and Easy
Leveraging the power of scikit-learn perform a quick classification task, using a bag of different classifiers.

 
Network Graph Analysis
Using the Networkx package, analyze a set of air routes between a group of countries and describe how they are connected.

 
Time Series: Extracting seasonality from drug sales
Seasonal effects might prevent seeing trends or other variables impacts. The statsmodels package gives us the tools to separate these effects from the data.

 
NLP/BERT: What is the rating of this review?
Using BERT and Neural Networks (Keras), determine the number of stars, or if a review is positive, negative or neutral.

 
Use of Association Rules and Market Basket Analysis:
Suggesting an airline the most logical airport to add to their list of destinations based on what other companies' are doing, using the apriori algorithm.

 
Descriptive Analysis: Billionaires around the world
Using basic descriptive analytics and a set of interesting Python packages I show a sample of analytics about the factors that might contribute to a billionaire's wealth.

 
NLP & Clustering: Classification of news reports based on the content of the text
Using NLP (doc2vec) and clustering (Birch) to find topics in the text of news articles.

 
Sample connections for Python Data Pipelines
Small sample of pipelines to extract data from local files, SQL server, Azure blob storage, Cosmos DB and generic ODBC connections.

 
Web scraping & NLP: Class movies based on their Wikipedia descriptions
Using different Python libraries I scrap movies from the Wikipedia list of best selling films in the US and do topic modeling on them to classify them.

 
High level example of a data engineering solution implemented in the cloud
This is a high-level description of a complete data management solution using Azure Cloud Services that I was able to conduct in real life.

 
Random Forest Classification: Demographic factors that influence income
Using random forest classification and decision trees I try to measure the impact of categorical and numerical demographic factors on the income of the people interviewed.

 
Unsupervised Clustering: Can we identify clusters in the descriptions of sounds in music?
Compare different clustering algorithms (unsupervised machine learning) to identify clusters in descriptions of songs.

 
Dashboards: Tableau or Power BI
A short and quick comparison between Tableau and Power BI as visualization tools.
