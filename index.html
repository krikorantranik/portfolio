								<h1><b>Krikor Postalian, MSc<b></h1>
								<p></br></p></h1>
								<p><b>Accomplished professional with a Masterâ€™s in data Analytics and 8+ years of expertise in Data Analytics and Data Science. Passionate about telling stories with data</b></p>
								<p><i>This is a small sample of my work</i></p>
							        <p> </p>
								<font size="-1">
								<p>Before getting into the technical aspects, these are some good philosophies that have helped me succeed so far as a data expert.</p>	
								<p>1. Know your goal and keep it always in sight: with data you want to tell a story, what is the story you want to tell? Once you start dabbling with numbers and algorithms it is easy to lose your sense of orientation. A clear research question will give you back a direction.</p>
								<p>2. Be honest, direct by sensible. There are good chances that someone is not going to like the message you are delivering, so you have to be conscious of the impact the results of your investigation might have on your audience, but the truth must be told, no matter how hard. In this sense, the quality of the data or research may be questioned, be confident of your work, but keep an open mind. And remember, nothing is personal.</p>
								<p>3. KISS: "Keep it simple stu...". Don't overcomplicate your delivery. It is fine and advisable to perform different algorithms and explore new technologies but there are good chances that the stakeholders don't want or don't have time to hear all about that. They want to see the conclusions, the rest is your work as an analyst, not theirs. Understandably, you want to show all that hard and good work, but there will be a time and place for that. Let your results do the talking for you.</p>
								<p>4. This point is also in line with the previous one: Remember Occam's Razor; of which I like Einstein's version: "The supreme goal of all theory is to make irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience". In layman's terms, the best theory is the one that uses less strong assumptions to explain correctly and completely the reality. When you are questioned between two possible explanations, usually the simpler one is correct.</p>
								<p>5. Know and list all the assumptions you are making along the whole pipeline of data analytics. From the collection of the data, its cleaning and storage to the algorithms used. In that sense, refrain from using an algorithm you don't understand, and take your time to know what are its limits, they all have them.</p>
								<p>6. Know your biases too. We all have them. Keep your personal opinions outside of your research. If you at one point are having issues with this point, look for validation to confirm that your methods and conclusions are valid and that you are delivering them as neutrally and free of personal remarks as possible.</p>
								<p>7. Have fun! Love what you do. The passion you put into your work will be shown and appreciated.</p>
